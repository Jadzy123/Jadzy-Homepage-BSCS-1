        I'am a bit of a curious person, born on
        <a href="../PUBLIC/Activity 3 Birthday.html">November 1, 2006</a>.
        I live on Malubal R. T. LIM Zamboanga Sibugay, my hometown.
        Now I take a boarding house. My hobbies are playing mobile legends
        and watching horror games. My favorite color is grey. I am a bit
        of a considerate person. I am the younger brother.

        I am a bit of a curious person, growing up, I was always looking
        for new experiences and learning opportunities. I think that's how
        I developed a passion for trying new things and meeting people, so
        this makes my own character. I have a quite low voice tone which is weird.
        I am always wanted to have a laptop, just to play games that I want
        hoping in the future it will be achieved.

        So I want to create my own game just a simple game because it is
        so interesting to tackle. For the future I want to be a game
        developer or software developer someday, so I am taking the Computer
        Science Course here in Western Mindanao State University Ipil Campus
        to achieve my goal. So that's it.
