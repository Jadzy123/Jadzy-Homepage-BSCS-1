        I am a bit of a curious person, born on
        <a href="../PUBLIC/Activity 3 Birthday.html">November 1, 2006</a>.
        I live in Malubal, R.T. Lim, Zamboanga Sibugay, my hometown.
        I am now staying in a boarding house. My hobbies are playing Mobile Legends
        and watching horror game playthroughs. My favorite color is grey. I am a 
        considerate person and the younger brother in my family.

        I am a bit of a curious person. Growing up, I was always looking
        for new experiences and learning opportunities. I think that is how
        I developed a passion for trying new things and meeting people, which
        helped shape my own character. I have quite a low voice tone, which 
        I find interesting. I have always wanted to have a laptop just to play 
        the games I enjoy, and I hope to achieve that in the future.

        I want to create my own game, just a simple one, because it is
        something I find truly interesting to explore. In the future, I want 
        to become a game developer or software developer, which is why I am 
        taking the Computer Science course here at Western Mindanao State 
        University, Ipil Campus, to achieve my goal. And that is all about me.
