    <h2>Biko Recipe</h2>
<h4>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>2 cups glutinous rice aka sticky rice</p></li>
    <li><p>1 1/2 cups water</p></li>
    <li><p>2 cups brown sugar</p></li>
    <li><p>4 cups coconut milk</p></li>
    <li><p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine the sticky rice and water in a rice cooker and cook
        until the rice is ready (we intentionaly combined lesser 
        amount of water than the usual so that the rice will not
         be fully cooked)
    </li>
    <li>
        While the rice is cooking, combine the coconut milk with
         brown sugar and salt in aseparate pot and cook in low heat
        until the texture becomes thick. Stir constantly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the rice is cooked and the coconut milk-sugar mixture
        is thick enough, add the cooked rice in the coconut milk and
        sugar mixture  then mix well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Continue cooking until all the liquid evaporates (but do not
        overcook).
    </li>
    <li>
        Scoop the cooked biko and place it in a serving plate then flatten
        the surface.
    </li>
