<h2>HYPER TEXT MARK UP LANGUAGE (HTML)</h2>
<h3>Is responsible of the content of the Website</h3>
<p>First paragraph. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard language 
    used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic
    building blocks for webpages by defining elements like headings, paragraphs,
    link, images, and multimedia.HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to 
    mark up content, enabling browsers to interpret and render it visually for
    user. For example, the p tag defines a paragraph, while the a tag creates
    hyperlinks, making HTML the backbone of web navigation and content
    presentation. HTML is a foundation technology of the web and works
    seamlessly with CSS (Cascading style sheets) for styling and JavaScript for
    interactivity. It is designed to be both human-readable and machine-
    interpretable, allowing developers to build structured documents. 
    With advancements like HTML5, the language has incorporated support for 
    rich media, such as video, and interactive elements, without requiring 
    additional plugins. this has made HTML more versatile and integral to 
    modern web development.</p>
<h2>CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS)</h2>
<h3>Is responsible of the style of the Website</h3>
<p>Second paragraph. cascading style sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
    used to describe the visual presentation of a documents written in markup 
    languages like HTML. CSS allows developers to separate content from design 
    by specifying style such as colors, fonts, layout, and spacing this 
    separation enables more efficient and consistent design management, as 
    changes to style can be made in one place and applied across multiple 
    pages or elements. CSS operates in a cascading manner, meaning that style 
    can be layered and prioritized based on the rules of inheritance and 
    specificity, giving developers fine-grained control over the appearance of 
    web content CSS is an essential part of modern web development because it 
    enhance the user experience by making web pages visually appealing and 
    interactive. it support responsive design, enabling website to adapt 
    seamlessly to different device and screen size. Additionally CSS can be 
    applied inline (within HTML elements), internally (in the style tag), or 
    externally (via linked, CSS files), with external stylesheets being the 
    most common and scalable approach. advance features of CSS, such as 
    animations, transition, and grid or flexbox layout, allows developers to 
    create dynamic and sophisticated web design without relying heavily on 
    JavaScript.</p>
<h2>JAVASCRIPT (JS)</h2>
<h3>Is responsible of the functionality of the Website</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a versatile and widely-use programming language primally 
    design for creating interactive and dynamic web application. It is a core 
    technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS, enabling 
    developers to build responsive user interfaces and add interactive 
    features such as animations, form validations, and real-time updates. 
    JavaScript is executed in web browsers, allowing it to modify the content 
    and behavior of web pages without needing to reload them. This client-side 
    capability has made it indispensable for modern web development. Beyond 
    the browsers, JavaScript has expanded its reach with platform like node 
    JS, which allows developers to write server-side code. This versability 
    has transformed JavaScript into a fall-stack languages capable of handling
    both front-end and back-end development. Additionally, it supports 
    numerous frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular and Vue.js, 
    which streamline the development process and help create feature-rich 
    applications.  Its ability to work across platforms and its continuous 
    evaluation have made JavaScript one of the most popular programming 
    languages in the world.</p>
